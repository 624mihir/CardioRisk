# 📊 Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores the **Heart Disease Dataset (2020)** using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and machine learning models to identify risk factors and predict heart disease.

## 🌐 Dataset Information
- **Source:** [CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
- **Size:** 300,000+ records, 18 features
- **Attributes:** Lifestyle habits, demographics, and medical conditions

## 🔎 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and performed feature encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Visualized distributions and correlations with Seaborn & Matplotlib.
  - Identified key risk factors (e.g., smoking, diabetes, BMI).
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Used **Chi-square tests & t-tests** to analyze relationships.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Trained **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest** models.
  - Achieved **>90% accuracy** after feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Insights & Recommendations**:
  - Suggested preventive measures based on data trends.

## 💪 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, MissingNo
- Scikit-Learn (ML models & evaluation)
- SciPy (Statistical tests)

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [Heart-Disease-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Prediction](https://github.com/624mihir/Heart-Disease-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Prediction)
   ```
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## 🏆 Results & Findings
- **[>90]% accuracy** on test data.
- Top risk factors: Smoking, BMI, Age, Diabetes.
- Lifestyle changes can significantly reduce heart disease risk.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
